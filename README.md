# MultiSpeciesModels_Conditional
R code detailing the fitting of joint and stacked SDMs to fisheries observer data, and the evaluation of conditional and conditional joint prediction. Conditional prediction is used here to predict unobserved discards in a trawl fishery using information on retained catch from logbooks.

Run:
- RandomForest fitting
- HMSC fitting
- GJAM fitting

Each script estimates and saves cross-validated predictive performance, which can then 
be compared in any form the user desires.
